IBS, Daejeon, South Korea - 22nd-26th September 2025</a></b></font></div>

<p>We are pleased to announce the third edition of our school on lattice techniques for cosmology. The event will take place from September 22 to 26, 2025, at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon, South Korea.</p>

<p><strong>Registration will open on June 20th 2025.</strong></p>

<p>This school offers a pedagogical introduction to lattice field theory techniques and their application to the simulation of interacting fields in an expanding Universe. Participants will also be introduced to <a href="http://cosmolattice.net">CosmoLattice</a>, an open-access code designed for such simulations. The school will provide a comprehensive guide to using CosmoLattice for modeling the non-linear dynamics of scalar and gauge fields in cosmological contexts.</p>

<p>The school is aimed to anyone who would like to learn (or simply improve their knowledge on) how to simulate in a lattice the dynamics of early Universe field theory scenarios. Topics covered include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Lattice field theory techniques</strong>: discretization schemes, lattice gauge techniques, and more</li>
	<li><strong>Numerical algorithms for differential equations</strong>: Leapfrog, Verlet, Runge-Kutta, etc</li>
	<li><strong>Overview of CosmoLattice</strong>: libraries, modularity, parallelization, ...</li>
	<li><strong>Lattice simulations of interacting fields in an expanding background</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>Scalar field dynamics with arbitrary potentials</li>
		<li>U(1) gauge theories coupled to complex charged scalars</li>
		<li>SU(2) gauge theories coupled to doublet charged scalars</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Modern applications to early Universe scenarios</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>Preheating scenarios and onset of radiation domination</li>
		<li>Production and evolution of gravitational waves</li>
		<li>Dynamics of derivatively coupled Axion-like fields</li>
		<li>Dynamics of non-minimally coupled scalar fields</li>
		<li>Fluid dynamics and gravitational waves from turbulence</li>
		<li>Evolution and experimental signatures of topological defects</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
