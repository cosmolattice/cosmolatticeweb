IFIC (Valencia, Spain) - 5th-8th September 2022</a></b></font></div>

This is a school aimed to provide a pedagogical introduction to lattice field theory techniques and their adaptation to simulate the dynamics of interacting fields in an expanding background. The lectures will serve as well as an introduction to CosmoLattice, a public code recently developed for lattice simulations of early Universe scenarios. The use of CosmoLattice as a tool to simulate scalar and gauge field non-linear dynamics in an expanding universe will be presented in full detail. Modern applications to preheating scenarios, gravitational wave production, non-minimally coupled scalar field dynamics, axion-like field dynamics, and maybe others, will also be covered.

The school is aimed to anyone who would like to learn (or simply improve their knowledge on) how to simulate in a lattice the dynamics of early Universe field theory scenarios. The lectures will cover:

* Lattice field theory techniques: discretisation schemes, lattice gauge techniques, and more.
* Numerical algorithms for differential equations: Leapfrog, Verlet, Runge-Kutta, etc
* Overview of CosmoLattice: libraries, modularity, parallelisation, ...
* Lattice simulations of interacting fields in an expanding background:
    - Scalar field dynamics with arbitrary potentials
    - U(1) gauge theories with complex charged scalars
    - SU(2) gauge theories with doublet charged scalars
* Modern applications to early Universe scenarios:
    - Preheating scenarios and onset of radiation domination
    - Production and evolution of gravitational waves
    - Dynamics of derivatively coupled Axion-like fields
    - Dynamics of non-minimally coupled scalar fields
    - Others, if time permits

Main lectures will be given by:

- Daniel G. Figueroa ........... IFIC, Valencia, Spain
- Adrien Florio  ......... Stony Brook, New York, US
- Francisco Torrenti .......... Basel U., Switzerland

Topical lectures will be given by:

- Jorge Baeza .......................  IFIC, Valencia, Spain
- Joanes Lizarraga  ......... UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain
- Nicolas Loayza  .................. IFIC, Valencia, Spain
- Toby Opferkuch  ............ Berkeley, California, US
- Ben A. Stefanek ............... Zurich U., Switzerland
- Ander Urio   ................... UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain

**Observations:** The school will he held in person in Valencia, Spain, during 5-8 Sept 2022. Applications can be sent till July 31st 2022 through this website. In case the demand exceeds our room capacity, we will give preference to young researchers (PhD students and postdocs). There is no fee, but participants are expected to cover their own accommodation (we will provide suggestions in due time). Participants are expected to bring their own laptop.

We look forward to welcoming you in sunny Valencia!
